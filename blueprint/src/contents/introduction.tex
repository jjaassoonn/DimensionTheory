\chapter{Introduction}

In this blueprint, we follow~\cite{MR1771925} to develop some dimension theory in Lean. Hopefully we the fundamental theorem done:
\begin{theorem}[the fundamental theorem]
  For a commutative Notherian local ring $R$ and an $R$-module $M$, we have
  \[
\dim M = d(M) = \delta(M).
  \]
\end{theorem}
